**You know you’re the right fit if…**

* You have 8+ years of experience developing and scaling web-based applications, preferably in a SaaS environment.
* You have a track record of leading high-stakes projects from initial ambiguity to successful launch–aligning stakeholders, making tough technical trade-offs, and ensuring long-term system health.
* You have experience leading architectural discussions, defining system design, and guiding technical decision-making.
* You have practical experience integrating AI/ML technologies into production-grade applications, understanding how to make non-deterministic systems reliable.
* You take a pragmatic approach to technology—adopting new tools where they add value, while mastering proven technologies.
* You care about long-term maintainability, advocate for clean architecture, and drive continuous refactoring and improvement.
* You balance intensity and sustainability—you’ll go the extra mile when needed but also model healthy work-life balance.

**Nice to Have:**

* Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Ph.D. in Computer Science or related technical discipline.

Roche’s Research and Early Development organisations at Genentech (gRED) and Pharma (pRED) have demonstrated how these technologies accelerate R&D, leveraging data and novel computational models to drive impact. Seamless data sharing and access to models across gRED and pRED are essential to maximising these opportunities. The new Computational Sciences Center of Excellence (CoE) is a strategic, unified group whose goal is to harness this transformative power of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist our scientists in both pRED and gRED to deliver more innovative and transformative medicines for patients worldwide.

**The Analytics and Workflows group within the Center of Excellence (CoE)** is dedicated to turning complex data into actionable insights that advance drug discovery and development. We leverage cutting-edge high-throughput technologies and foundational multimodal machine learning models to analyze large-scale biological and chemical data, enabling deeper understanding of molecular behavior and the identification of novel therapeutic opportunities. Despite advances in these fields, however, transforming raw data and computational models into meaningful insights remains a key challenge. In this role, you’ll work at the intersection of data science, genomics, and engineering to build innovative analytical tools that bridge the gap between data generation and interpretation, helping unlock new avenues for scientific discovery and impact.

**The Opportunity:**

We are seeking a Senior Scientific Software Engineer to develop analytical and visualization-driven tools to support the identification and qualification of drug targets**.** In this role, you will collaborate closely with cross-functional partners to translate computational methods and biological data into intuitive user experiences that enable scientists to explore evidence, test hypotheses, and evaluate new targets.

Your work will include:

* Partnering directly with biologists, computational scientists, and AI researchers to understand analysis workflows, including ambiguous or evolving scientific needs, where biological hypotheses, data quality, and sources of evidence are actively being evaluated and refined.
* Identifying, evaluating, and applying emerging technologies to analyze and visualize diverse omics, biochemical, and biophysical datasets in support of drug discovery and development.
* Designing and implementing intuitive analytical tools that allow scientific teams to access, share, and interpret heterogeneous sources of biological evidence, abstracting technical complexity while enabling scientific insight.
* Collaborating across distributed scientific, engineering, and design teams to support the evolution of analytical tools, from early exploratory analyses through robust applications.

**Who you are:**

* A PhD in a computational biological discipline with 0–2 years of experience, or a BS/MS with 4+ years of relevant industry experience.
* Strong analytical intuition for reasoning about complex biological datasets in experimental contexts, integrating evidence across modalities to support scientific decision-making.
* Demonstrated experience turning messy, high-dimensional biological data into interpretable signals that inform biological hypotheses.
* Experience using Python- or R-based tools for data analysis and visualization (e.g., Altair, Seaborn, Bokeh, Streamlit, Dash; ggplot2 or Shiny), with the ability to design static and interactive visualizations that communicate insights and support scientific interpretation, discussion, and decision-making.
* Comfort working at the interface of biology, data science, and computation, translating analytical results or model outputs into interpretable insights that inform experimental scientists and drive data-driven discovery.
* Experience collaborating closely with multidisciplinary teams in exploratory, pre-standardized problem spaces, where questions, data, and success criteria evolve over time.
* Familiarity with modern web frameworks and interactive, data-rich visualization libraries such as D3.js or Plotly.
* Curiosity, a growth mindset, and enthusiasm for developing new skills while collaborating across diverse, multidisciplinary teams.

Onsite presence, on our South San Francisco campus, is expected for at least 3 days a week.

Relocation benefits are not available for this job posting.

The expected salary range for this position based on the primary location of California is $142,500 - $264,700.

---------------

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing (CQC) is a multi-disciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and technicians, on a mission to develop a fault-tolerant quantum computer.  
  
We are looking to hire a Research DevOps Engineer to join our growing software team. You will work closely with our experimental and theoretical physics teams to enable their work characterizing, calibrating, and operating novel quantum devices. The ideal candidate will be able to translate high-level science requirements into DevOps deliverables (e.g. CI/CD scripts, hybrid infrastructure-as-code setups, standardized development environments, artifact repositories, etc.) that are performant, scalable, and secure. This requires someone who (1) has a strong desire to work within a team of scientists and engineers, and (2) demonstrates ownership in initiating and driving projects to completion. As a Research DevOps Engineer, this role has a particular emphasis accelerating the research software development lifecycle at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing through automation, standardization, and managing hybrid (cloud + physical lab) infrastructure.  
  
Why AWS?  
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. We pioneered cloud computing and never stopped innovating — that’s why customers from the most successful startups to Global 500 companies trust our robust suite of products and services to power their businesses.  
  
AWS Utility Computing (UC) provides product innovations — from foundational services such as Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), to consistently released new product innovations that continue to set AWS’s services and features apart in the industry. As a member of the UC organization, you’ll support the development and management of Compute, Database, Storage, Internet of Things (Iot), Platform, and Productivity Apps services in AWS. Within AWS UC, Amazon Dedicated Cloud (ADC) roles engage with AWS customers who require specialized security solutions for their cloud services.  
  
Inclusive Team Culture  
Here at AWS, it’s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.  
  
Diverse Experiences  
AWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn’t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don’t let it stop you from applying.  
  
Mentorship & Career Growth  
We’re continuously raising our performance bar as we strive to become Earth’s Best Employer. That’s why you’ll find endless knowledge-sharing, mentorship and other career-advancing resources here to help you develop into a better-rounded professional.  
  
Work/Life Balance  
We value work-life harmony. Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is why we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there’s nothing we can’t achieve in the cloud.  
  
Export Control Requirement  
Due to applicable export control laws and regulations, candidates must be either a U.S. citizen or national, U.S. permanent resident (i.e., current Green Card holder), or lawfully admitted into the U.S. as a refugee or granted asylum, or be able to obtain a US export license. If you are unsure if you meet these requirements, please apply and Amazon will review your application for eligibility.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
Responsibilities include some combination of the following:  
  

* Design and maintain standardized, reproducible development environments for research scientists.
* Own dependency, build, and release management across interdependent research software projects.
* Develop and streamline CI/CD pipelines for low-overhead automated testing and rapid deployment.
* Manage hybrid infrastructure spanning cloud services and on-prem physical hardware.
* Automate provisioning and configuration using infrastructure-as-code solutions (e.g. Docker, AWS CDK).
* Maintain Amazon’s high security bar without slowing down the pace of internal development.
* Implement best practices for observability and monitoring to enable rapid debugging and high service uptime.
* Empower others to actively contribute to the codebase through mentorship and documentation.

  
We are looking for candidates with strong engineering principles, a bias for action, superior problem-solving, and excellent communication skills. Working effectively within a team environment is essential. As a DevOps engineer embedded in a research organization, you will have the opportunity to work on new ideas and stay abreast of the field of experimental quantum computation.  
  
A day in the life  
The majority of your time will be spent on projects that accelerate the development of our internal research software stack. This requires working backwards from the needs of our science staff in the context of our larger experimental roadmap. You will translate science and software requirements into design proposals balancing implementation complexity against time-to-delivery. Once a design proposal has been reviewed and accepted, you’ll drive implementation and coordinate with internal stakeholders to ensure a smooth roll out. Because many high-level experimental goals have cross-cutting requirements, you’ll often work closely with other engineers or scientists or on the team.  
  
About the team  
You will be joining the software team within the AWS Center of Quantum Computing. Our team is comprised of scientists and engineers who are building scalable software that enables quantum computing technologies.

**BASIC QUALIFICATIONS**

Custom silicon chips live at the heart of AWS Machine Learning servers, and this team builds the backend software that runs these servers. We’re looking for someone to lead our SoC (System on Chip) device-driver / HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) software team. You'll help us deliver at scale as we build the next generation of SoC software. This is a hands-on, in-the-trenches leadership position, where you’ll manage systems, debug issues, and write code alongside your team.  
  
As the Manager for SoC driver software, you will:
  

* Manage a team of 6 developers
* Work with hardware designers to write drivers for newly developed SoC IPs
* Work with system software teams to solve SoC and system-level architectural issues, drive debug, and innovate on cross-functional solutions
* Refactor and maintain existing codebases throughout the device lifecycle
* Continuously test and deploy your software stack to multiple internal customers
* Innovate on the tooling you provide to customers, making it easier for them to use and debug our SoCs

  
Annapurna Labs, our organization within AWS, designs and deploys some of the largest custom silicon in the world, with many subsystems that all must be managed, tested, and monitored. The SoC drivers are a critical piece of the AWS infrastructure management software stack that ensures the chip is functional, performant, and secure.
  
  
You will thrive in this role if you:
  

* Enjoy building, managing, and leading small teams
* Love solving complex system-level issues
* Are proficient in C++ and familiar with Python
* Know how to build effective abstractions over low-level SoC details
* Are familiar with modular driver architectures (such as the Linux or Windows driver stacks)
* Have strong opinions about software architecture, and are able to apply them effectively
* Enjoy learning new technologies, building software at scale, moving fast, and working closely with colleagues as part of a small, startup-like team within a large organization

  
Although we build and deploy machine learning chips, no machine learning background is needed for this role. Your team (and your software) won’t be doing machine learning. Our driver stack lives at the lowest level of the backend AWS infrastructure responsible for managing our ML servers. You and your team will develop drivers for components used by machine learning, like PCIe and HBM, but won’t need to deeply understand ML yourselves.  
  
This role can be based in either Cupertino, CA or Austin, TX. The team is split between the two sites, with most of the team sitting in Cupertino, and customers in both.  
  
We're changing an industry. We're searching for individuals who are ready for this challenge, who want to reach beyond what is possible today. Come join us and build the future of machine learning!

This role is highly impactful: your contributions will form the backbone of the systems that deliver personalized, context-aware guidance to millions of advertisers. You will collaborate across science, product, and platform teams, and your work will focus on building resilient, observable, and maintainable systems that accelerate innovation in agent-based AI.  
  
Key job responsibilities  

* Implement core services and APIs for agent orchestration, tool invocation, and state management.
* Build scalable, reusable data and tool registry
* Build components of evaluation pipelines (offline/online) for measuring reasoning quality, advertiser outcomes, and safety guardrails.
* Develop infrastructure to support fine-tuning and reinforcement learning pipelines, collaborating with scientists to productionize workflows.
* Ensure performance, scalability, observability, and maintainability through strong engineering practices.
* Participate in system design, code reviews, and team architecture discussions.
* Continuously learn and apply new techniques in agentic frameworks, distributed systems, and cloud-native development.

  
About the team  
The Sponsored Products and Brands team at Amazon Ads is re-imagining the advertising landscape through the latest generative AI technologies, revolutionizing how millions of customers discover products and engage with brands across Amazon.com and beyond. We are at the forefront of re-inventing advertising experiences, bridging human creativity with artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the advertising lifecycle from ad creation and optimization to performance analysis and customer insights.  
We are a passionate group of innovators dedicated to developing responsible and intelligent AI technologies that balance the needs of advertisers, enhance the shopping experience, and strengthen the marketplace. If you're energized by solving complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI, join us in shaping the future of advertising.  
The Advertiser Guidance team within Sponsored Products and Brands is focused on guiding and supporting 1.6MM advertisers to meet their advertising needs of creating and managing ad campaigns. At this scale, the complexity of diverse advertiser goals, campaign types, and market dynamics creates both a massive technical challenge and a transformative opportunity: even small improvements in guidance systems can have outsized impact on advertiser success and Amazon’s retail ecosystem.  
Our vision is to build a highly personalized, context-aware agentic advertiser guidance system that leverages LLMs together with tools such as auction simulations, ML models, and optimization algorithms. This agentic framework, will operate across both chat and non-chat experiences in the ad console, scaling to natural language queries as well as proactively delivering guidance based on deep understanding of the advertiser. To execute this vision, we collaborate closely with stakeholders across Ad Console, Sales, and Marketing to identify opportunities—from high-level product guidance down to granular keyword recommendations—and deliver them through a tailored, personalized experience. Our work is grounded in state-of-the-art agent architectures, tool integration, reasoning frameworks, and model customization approaches (including tuning, MCP, and preference optimization), ensuring our systems are both scalable and adaptive.

Our custom chips, accelerators, and software stacks enable us to take on technical challenges that have never been seen before, and deliver results that help our customers change the world.  
  
AWS Neuron is the complete software stack for the AWS Trainium (Trn1/Trn2) and Inferentia (Inf1/Inf2) our cloud-scale Machine Learning accelerators. This role is for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in the Distribute Training team for AWS Neuron, responsible for development, enablement and performance tuning of a wide variety of ML model families, including massive-scale Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT and Llama, as well as Stable Diffusion, Vision Transformers (ViT) and many more.  
  
The ML Distributed Training team works side by side with chip architects, compiler engineers and runtime engineers to create, build and tune distributed training solutions with Trainium instances. Experience with training these large models using Python is a must. FSDP (Fully-Sharded Data Parallel), Deepspeed, Nemo and other distributed training libraries are central to this and extending all of this for the Neuron based system is key.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
You will lead efforts to build distributed training support into PyTorch and JAX using XLA, the Neuron compiler, and runtime stacks. You will optimize models to achieve peak performance and maximize efficiency on AWS custom silicon, including Trainium and Inferentia, as well as Trn2, Trn1, Inf1, and Inf2 servers. Strong software development skills, the ability to deep dive, work effectively within cross-functional teams, and a solid foundation in Machine Learning are critical for success in this role.  
  
About the team  
Annapurna Labs was a startup company acquired by AWS in 2015, and is now fully integrated. If AWS is an infrastructure company, then think Annapurna Labs as the infrastructure provider of AWS.
